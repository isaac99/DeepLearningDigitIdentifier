# DeepLearningDigitIdentifier

This program uses OpenCV and trains/detects digits in video and in photos. It works on numbers in different orientations, rotations, and if they are obscured. Some of the code is commented out for training the model, because it takes a few hours to train on the dataset. For detailed explanation, please see the attached report.
